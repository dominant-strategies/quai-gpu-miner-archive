/** @brief Simple block guard.
 * The expression/block following is guarded though the given mutex.
 * Usage:
 * @code
 * Mutex m;
 * unsigned d;
 * ...
 * ETH_(m) d = 1;
 * ...
 * ETH_(m) { for (auto d = 10; d > 0; --d) foo(d); d = 0; }
 * @endcode
 *
 * There are several variants of this basic mechanism for different Mutex types and Guards.
 *
 * There is also the UNGUARD variant which allows an unguarded expression/block to exist within a
 * guarded expression. eg:
 *
 * @code
 * Mutex m;
 * int d;
 * ...
 * ETH_GUARDED(m)
 * {
 *   for (auto d = 50; d > 25; --d)
 *     foo(d);
 *   ETH_UNGUARDED(m)
 *     bar();
 *   for (; d > 0; --d)
 *     foo(d);
 * }
 * @endcode
