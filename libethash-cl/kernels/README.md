# ethash-kernels
For whatever reason, Zawawawa released his Ethash kernels as open source code. This repo is a verbaitm copy of that code with a simplistic build environment and [Ethminer](https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer) as a target. Although the code for Ethminer has yet to be released.

## Requirements
On Linux, all you need is [clrxasm](https://github.com/CLRX/CLRX-mirror) installed. Everything should build fairly quickly, just make sure to ```mkdir build``` before you ```make```. MacOS should be the same. Windows ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
